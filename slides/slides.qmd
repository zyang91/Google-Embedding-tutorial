## What is Embeddings?

<br>

[ In general terms, embeddings are **numerical representations** of complex information that capture the **most important features or relationships** in a simplified, machine-readable form. ]{style="font-size: 1.3em;"}

## Blackbox Nature of Embeddings

-   The Embeddings generally generated through various neural network models (GNN or CNN) that trained on a large datasets.
-   The exact architecture and training process can vary widely depending on the specific application and data type.
-   The company or research institutions that developed the embeddings may not disclose the full details of their models due to proprietary or privacy reasons.

## Population Dynamics Foundation (PDFM) Embeddings

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Developed by Google Research (Google Deep Mind) in 2024.
-   Input:
    -   Census data
    -   Searching Trends
    -   Other geospatial data
-   Output:
    -   Multi-dimensional vectors (represent population characteristics and dynamics).

## How PDFM Embeddings look like?

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **330-dimensional vectors** for each census tract or ZIP code
-   Each dimension captures different aspects of population dynamics
-   Examples of captured features:
    -   Mobility patterns
    -   Search behavior trends
    -   Local economic activity
    -   Environmental conditions
:::

::: {.column width="3%"}
:::

::: {.column width="47%"}
**Key Properties:**

-   Standardized across locations
-   Privacy-preserving (aggregated data)
-   Ready for machine learning models
-   Can be used for similarity analysis

## Satellite Embeddings with Google Earth Engine (GEE)

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Dataset:**

-   `GOOGLE/SATELLITE_EMBEDDING/V1/ANNUAL`
-   65 bands (dimensions) per pixel
-   Annual composites
-   Global coverage

**Key Operations:**

:::

::: {.column width="47%"}
**Example Use:**

```python
# Load embeddings
dataset = ee.ImageCollection(
  "GOOGLE/SATELLITE_EMBEDDING/V1/ANNUAL"
)

# Get year 1 and year 2
image1 = dataset.filterDate(
  "2017-01-01", "2018-01-01"
).first()

# Compare similarity
dot_prod = image1.multiply(image2)
  .reduce(ee.Reducer.sum())
```

::: {.column width="47%"}
**Technical Limitations:**

-   Temporal coverage limited (2017-2023)
-   Resolution constraints (10m for satellite)
-   Requires significant computational resources
-   Updates not in real-time

**Trust and Decision-Making:**

-   Should not be sole basis for critical decisions
-   Needs domain expertise for validation
-   Privacy concerns with aggregated data
-   Proprietary models limit reproducibility
