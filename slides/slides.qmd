## What is Embeddings?

<br>

[In general terms, embeddings are **numerical representations** of complex information that capture the **most important features or relationships** in a simplified, machine-readable form.]{style="font-size: 1.3em;"}

## Blackbox Nature of Embeddings

<br>

-   Generated through various neural network models (GNN or CNN) trained on a large datasets.
-   Exact architecture and training process vary widely.
-   The company or research institutions may not disclose the full details of their models.

## Population Dynamics Foundation (PDFM) Embeddings

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Developed by Google Research (Google Deep Mind) in 2024.
-   Input:
    -   Census data
    -   Searching Trends
    -   Other geospatial data
-   Output:
    -   Multi-dimensional vectors (represent population characteristics and dynamics).

## How PDFM Embeddings look like?

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **330-dimensional vectors** for each census tract or ZIP code
-   Each dimension captures different aspects of population dynamics
-   Examples of captured features:
    -   Mobility patterns
    -   Search behavior trends
    -   Local economic activity
    -   Environmental conditions

## Applications of PDFM Embeddings


**Health & Social Services:**

-   Disease prevalence prediction
-   Healthcare resource allocation

**Economic Analysis:**

-   Socioeconomic indicators modeling
-   Income and poverty estimation

**Urban Planning:**

-   Population growth forecasting
-   POI and hotspot prediction



## Demo 1: Using PDFM Embeddings to predict housing prices

**Dataset:**

-   Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) by ZIP code
-   PDFM embeddings (330 features)

**Model:**

-   Linear Regression (Stepwise regression)
-   Data mining approaches
-   Output: Predicted home prices



## Satellite Foundation Model (SFM) Embeddings

-   Developed by Google Research
-   Based on Sentinel-2 satellite imagery
-   **Global coverage** (2017-2023)
-   Spatial resolution: 10 meters
-   Available through Google Earth Engine



## What they capture

-   Land cover patterns
-   Vegetation characteristics
-   Urban development
-   Environmental changes
-   Temporal dynamics

[Trained on massive satellite imagery corpus using self-supervised learning]{style="font-size: 0.9em;"}


## Satellite Embeddings with Google Earth Engine (GEE)

**Dataset:**

-   `GOOGLE/SATELLITE_EMBEDDING/V1/ANNUAL`
-   65 bands

**Key Operations:**

-   Filter by date and location
-   Extract embeddings for points/regions
-   Compare temporal changes
-   Calculate similarity (dot product)

## Applications of SFM Embeddings

**Environmental and Land Use Planning**

-   Urban sprawl analysis
-   Land cover classification
-   Change detection
-   Development planning

**Temporal Analysis:**

-   Seasonal pattern detection
-   Long-term trend analysis
-   Before/after comparisons
-   Similarity searches across time

## Demo 2: Satellite Embeddings for Land Cover Classification

**Approach:**

-   Use embeddings as features
-   Train classification model
-   Predict land cover types

**Advantages:**

-   No need to process raw imagery
-   Pre-trained representations
-   Faster than traditional methods

## Workflow

1.  Define area of interest
2.  Load embedding ImageCollection
3.  Extract features for labeled samples
4.  Train classifier (Random Forest, SVM)
5.  Apply to entire region
6.  Validate results

[Uses Earth Engine's cloud computing for scalability]{style="font-size: 0.9em;"}

## Limitations and Concerns

**Interpretability Issues:**

-   Black box representations
-   Limited transparency in training process

**Bias and Fairness:**

-   May encode historical biases
-   Risk of perpetuating spatial inequalities

**Technical Limitations:**

-   Resolution constraints (10m for satellite)
-   Updates not in real-time

...

## Summary and Conclusions

**The Promise:**

-   Powerful tools for spatial analysis
-   Capture complex patterns (Privacy concerns)

**The Reality:**

-   Require careful validation
-   Complement, not replace

**Best Practices:**

-   Validate predictions thoroughly
-   Be aware of limitations and biases

## Final Verdict

[Powerful GeoAI tools, but use with caution and critical thinking!]{style="font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: bold;"}
